  desc: A slightly unstable medication used for the most extreme case of radiation poisoning. Lowers radiation level at over twice the rate Hyronalin does and will heal toxin damage at the same time. Deals very minor brute damage to the patient over time, but the patient's body will typically out-regenerate it easily.
