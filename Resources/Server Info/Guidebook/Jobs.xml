# Jobs

SS14 has a large number of jobs, divided into seven major departments:

## Service
This department includes the janitor, passengers, clown, mime, musician, chef, bartender, the head of personnel, and other jobs who exist to serve the station.

It primarily functions as folks who entertain, clean, and serve the rest of the crew, with the exception of passengers who have no particular job [color=#888084]beyond getting lost in maintenance[/color].

## Cargo
Cargo consists of the cargo technicians, salvage technicians, and the quartermaster. As a department, it is responsible for resource distribution and trade, capable of buying and selling things on the galactic market.

For the most part, this means they scrounge around the station and assorted wrecks to find materials to sell and redistribute, and purchase materials other departments request.

## Security
Security consists of the security cadets, lawyers, security officers, warden, and the head of security. As a department, it is responsible for dealing with troublemakers and non-humanoid threats like giant rats and carp.

As a result of this, and the need to walk a fine line, security sometimes is overwhelmed by angry crew [color=#888084](don't kill the clown)[/color], and it is important for its members to try and stay on their best behavior.

## Medical
Medical consists of the medical interns, chemists, medical doctors, and the chief medical officer. As a department, it is responsible for taking care of the crew, treat and/or clone the wounded and dead, treat disease, and [color=#888084]prevent anyone from dying a horrible, bloody death in a closet somewhere.[/color]

Medical is one of the more well-equipped departments, with the ability to locate injured crew using the crew monitor, a nigh infinite supply of chems should chemistry be on-par, and the ability to rapidly diagnose and vaccinate contagious diseases.

## Epistemics
Epistemics consists of acolytes, golemancers, a forensic mantis and the Mystagogue. As a department, it is responsible for containing and investigating anomalies and artefacts and dealing with psionics and the paranormal.

## Engineering
Engineering consists of technical assistants, station engineers, atmospheric technicians, and the chief engineer. As a department, it is responsible for keeping the station powered, its structure intact and its air supply working.

Engineering is readily equipped to go safely into space, and as such they should always attempt to repair uninhabitable parts of the station.

## Command
Command consists of the captain, the head of personnel, the head of security, the chief engineer, the chief medical officer, and the research director. As a department, it is responsible for keeping the station and its departments running efficiently.

Command members should always be relatively competent in their respective departments and attempt to delegate responsibility and direct work.
