# Reverse Engineering

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ReverseEngineeringMachine"/>

The reverse engineering machine allows salvage to bootstrap their way into unlocking powerful lathe recipes that are otherwise unacquirable.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AdvancedScanningModuleStockPart"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NanoManipulatorStockPart"/>

The machine's power is very limited without upgrades to its scanning module and manipulator.
The scanning module increases its analysis power and the manipulator decreases the chance of destruction with safety turned off.

## Operation

The machine will only accept items it can reverse engineer. Currently this is most circuitboards and machine parts, but it accepts quite a variety of objects.

It does not and will never accept firearms.

To use the machine, insert an item, and use the buttons on the left.

[color=#0000FF] Analyze [/color]
This starts a new reverse engineering attempt.

[color=#0000FF] Safety [/color]
With safety off, you have more analysis power but there is a chance to destroy the item.

[color=#0000FF] AutoProbe [/color]
This will automatically start a new attempt when the last one ends.

[color=#0000FF] Stop [/color]
Stops the current attempt.

[color=#0000FF] Item [/color]
Ejects the item.
