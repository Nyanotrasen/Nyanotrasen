# Epistemics

Epistemics, or Research and Development for people who refuse to use such a self-aggrandizing name, is one of the main departments on NanoTrasen stations.
They are tolerated despite their strange customs and tendency to attract all sorts of weirdness to the station.

The most important thing inside your department is the R&D server, which stores unlocked technologies, and the R&D computer, which allows you to unlock technologies.

Each technology costs [color=#a4885c]Research Points[/color] and unlocks recipes at lathes. Some technologies will also have prerequesites you have to unlock before you can research them.

At a lathe, you can sync to a server to allow it print whatever recipes you have unlocked. Recipes require various materials (steel, glass, plastic, gold, plasma) which can be acquired at Cargo or Salvage.

## Oracle
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Oracle" />

Oracle is your benefactor, dispensing lots of strange liquids and research points. Is she a statue, a goddess, some sort of devious trap? Everyone has their own approach to her, but she doesn't seem to mind any of them.
