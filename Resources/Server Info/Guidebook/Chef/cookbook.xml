[color=#a4885c]Grains and sugar[/color] will be a mainstay in any chef's menu. They are normally grown in Hydroponics and then processed in the grinder.

[color=#a4885c]Meat[/color] is acquired from most any carcass. Smaller creatures can simply be butchered with any sharp instrument by right-clicking them and clicking the [color=#a4885c]Butcher[/color] option. Larger ones need to be impaled on a [color=#a4885c]meat spike[/color] and then cut into portions with a [color=#a4885c]knife[/color]. [color=#888084]Be careful about answering questions of the meat's origins, though.[/color]

Meat can be processed into animal protein in the grinder, or can be sliced with a knife into [color=#a4885c]cutlets[/color].

[color=#a4885c]Dairy[/color] is another big part of humanoid diet. A [color=#a4885c]cow[/color] is often provided, which can be milked, though it has to be fed fruit or wheat and water on occasion to keep lactating. [color=#a4885c]Cheese and butter[/color] are made in reaction between milk and [color=#a4885c]universal enzyme[/color] or salt, respectively. [color=#fcdf03]The latter is a catalyst and is not consumed by making dairy products.[/color] Cheese can be sliced into [color=#a4885c]wedges[/color].

[color=#a4885c]Soy milk[/color] is available, but is not a substitute for regular milk. There are other foods one can make of it, however.
