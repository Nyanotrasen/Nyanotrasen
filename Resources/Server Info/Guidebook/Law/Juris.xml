# Jurisdiction

This section outlines the most important points about the extent of Space Law and privileges granted by it.

##Security

- There are [color=#fcdf03]no legal grounds[/color] to resist an arrest or detainment by Security. [color=#a00000]None.[/color]
- If you are suspected of having commited a crime, Security may [color=#a4885c]detain[/color] you (which may involve restraints) and question you.
- If Security, or another crew member, decide to press charges, you will be [color=#a4885c]arrested[/color]. This will involve processing and searching at Security.
- Security holds an unrestricted weapon license. [color=#fcdf03]It is authorized to use lethal force in serious circumstances at any time.[/color]

##Psionic Powers

[color=#a4885c]Psychics[/color] are largely ungoverned by Space Law. While it offers options to protect them or persecute them, using them is at discretion of Station Command.

## Synthetics

[color=#a4885c]Borgs[/color] and any other artificial entity associated with Nyanotrasen is its property, and to damage it is to damage company property, which is punishable by law.

##Foreign Vessels

- The Captain decides whether to welcome visitors, grant asylum, and where to give them or deny them access.
- All visitors aboard your station are subject to Space Law. When you visit another vessel, you're subject to theirs.
- [color=#a4885c]Hot Pursuit[/color] doctrine applies, but in all other cases, [color=#fcdf03]the sovereignty of a foreign vessel must be observed.[/color]
