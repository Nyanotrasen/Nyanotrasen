# Space Law

Within Nyanotrasen, stations operate under [color=#a4885c]Space Law[/color]. All persons aboard the station are beholden to this law and expected to follow it. Common sense knowledge should be sufficient to not break the law, but for your convenience, a Quick Reference on a variety of topics is provided.

Members of Security and the Captain will often require a far deeper understanding of the law. For the full edition of Space Law, see [url=https://wiki.nyanotrasen.moe/view/Space_Law]our Wiki[/url].
