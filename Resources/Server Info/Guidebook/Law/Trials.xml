# Trial Procedure

On Nyanotrasen, trials are conducted in the form of an [color=#a4885c]arbitration.[/color] This means that:

- You are [color=#fcdf03]not required[/color] to have a [color=#a4885c]lawyer[/color].
- You need a trial only when you are accused of a [color=#a4885c]Capital Crime[/color].
- There is [color=#fcdf03]no jury[/color], the verdict is assessed and passed by the [color=#a4885c]judge.[/color]
- Prosecution is represented by the Security member best familiar with the case.
- The [color=#a4885c]Head of Security[/color] will often be the judge, or the [color=#a4885c]Captain[/color]. There are criteria for Conflict of Interest, but just holding these titles - or having been involved in one's prosecution - does not disqualify them.
- The trial is intended to be done fast, within 15 minutes. The judge will typically simply ask both sides their case of why their verdict should pass, then decide.

Trials don't only have to be held for criminal issues, anyone can sue anyone, provided they manage to find a Command player to convene a trial. Lawyers are also entirely welcome to represent someone, they are simply not required. Trials for [color=#a4885c]Felonies[/color] are preferably conducted if particularly serious, but not required.
