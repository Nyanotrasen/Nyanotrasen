[color=#ff0000]You must be 17 or older to play. Users under 17 will be banned immediately.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Try not to ruin other people's rounds. You shouldn't remove someone from the round unless you are an antagonist, or they are an antagonist that has caused quite a headache for the station.
    - The rules are slightly more lax for killing ghost roles, but leave them alone unless they're being a nuisance.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] If you are playing a head, or a member of engineering, security, or medical, you should attempt to do your job.
    - Egregious dereliction of duty may result in a roleban from all station-critical roles.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Try to write English to the best of your ability. Use punctuation, capitalization, and correct spelling.
    - Repeat offenders of this rule will be assumed to be children and banned.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Try not to needlessly escalate situations, and be receptive to deescalations.
    - If neither party in a dispute is attempting to deescalate, we'll assume it's mutual combat and avoid any ruling.
    - If you're a non-antagonist, don't instigate major situations like revolutions, murders, and so on.
    - Lethal force should only be used in response to lethal force. Even then, if you crit or kill someone, you should probably take them to medbay and inform sec.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color].

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Harassment of other players for OOC/meta reasons is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
	- Annoying somebody in a round for IC/RP reasons is fine. Doing it consistently across multiple rounds for OOC reasons (“I don’t like this player” AKA metagrudging) to the point where it becomes seriously problematic for the other player(s) is [color=#ff0000]not[/color].

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are not allowed.
	- Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, orientation or the like is not tolerated.
	- Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Offensive/bad/out-of-character character names put you at the mercy of administrators, from receiving brain damage to becoming valid to straight up getting banned on the spot depending on how bad they are. Character names should be something a real person might have for a name.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Knowingly using exploits, external programs, or other unintended game mechanics to powergame, slow down, or crash the server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Multi-keying/Alts on the same server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
	- Admins may ask players in possession of multiple alt accounts to choose one to play on and ban the other accounts.
	- If you are caught knowingly using alt accounts you may have your main account banned as well.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Using information gained outside the game to your advantage is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color]. IC and OOC are to be kept separate at all times.
	- Metacommunication, or communicating with other players via out of game methods (such as Discord) to gain an unfair advantage is also strictly [color=#ff0000]prohibited[/color].
    - This is a roleplaying game, thus IC conflicts must only be resolved with IC (Local) chat, utilizing voice chat, calling across the room, OOC, or other out-of-game communication methods to coordinate in-game actions is forbidden and will result in a [color=#ff0000]appeal-only permanent ban[/color] in most cases.
	- Preemptive spacing or destruction of high-risk items also falls under this rule.

RULES FOR SECURITY
[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Security is expected to use non-lethal measures unless faced with lethal force or a situation where non-lethal measures aren't possible. Ideally, do not enter combat mode, as security stun batons do not deal damage, but still stun, when outside of combat mode.
    - If you still manage to kill someone as security, get them cloned immediately, and make sure their stuff is returned.

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Prisoners should not be given sentences longer than 10 minutes. Certain extreme exceptions like bombers and assassins may warrant permabrigging, or [color=#ff0000]in the very worst cases[/color], execution.
    - Note that employment at a hostile corporation (i.e. traitor status) alone [color=#ff0000]does not[/color] qualify someone for perma or execution.
