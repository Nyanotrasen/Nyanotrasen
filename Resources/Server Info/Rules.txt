[color=#ff0000]You must be 17 or older to play. Users under 17 will be banned immediately.[/color]

Nyanotrasen is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job and delegating tasks that are outside of that description.
This is not to imply you just work all round; almost every job has more downtime than not. There's also wide variety of jobs that are completely downtime.

[color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] All of these rules apply as they are intended. Do not argue small wording or punctuation technicalities like we're in court.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Do not speak about out-of-character concepts in chat or radio. Use LOOC for that. Do not speak about in character concepts in LOOC. Use chat or for that.
    - Using emote or LOOC to bypass IC chat restrictions is considered exploiting.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] As a non-antagonist, realize it's not your job to cause chaos.
    - Breaking into departmentss with no one working them because you need something from them is okay, barring the armory unless there is a xeno invasion or similar.
    - Do not sabotage atmos or power, or anything that would harm the station's ability to support life and job functions.
    - Do not create anything that will cause unexpecting people to die, such as poison pills or hidden electrified grills.
    - Don't interfere in other people's arrests.
    - Petty crime is an IC issue. However, it's very much preferred you stick to unimportant roles like assistant if you're in that sort of mood.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Follow basic common sense -- act as a reasonable person would in your character's shoes.
    - This isn't a deathmatch, be humane.
    - What is considered a reasonable reason to escalate conflict is listed below under ESCALATION RULES and is at the discretion of admins.
    - Ask admins for permission first before any actions that involve a large amount of players causing trouble, such as a revolution. Even as an antagonist you will be dragging non-antags into it.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color].

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Harassment of other players for OOC/meta reasons is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are not allowed.
	- Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, orientation or the like is not tolerated.
	- Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
    - In a station full of strange alien coworkers, the occasional comment may be tolerated. Do not roleplay a "racist" character or discriminate against anyone.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Your IC name must be realistic. Avoid joke names and names of fictional or real people, or names playing off of them (e.g. Saul Badman.)
    - Roles like clown and mime are allowed stage names, which can be IC jokes but not OOC references.
    - You can press the random name button in the character creator with a species selected to see what sort of names they have.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Cheating using external programs, multi-keying, alternate accounts, or exploiting to crash the server or gain a large mechanical advantage will all result in an appeal-only permanent ban.
    - [color=#ff0000] Talking about the round with other players using an external program (e.g. Discord) is cheating. [/color] It's called metacommunications and you should not do it here or in any other server.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] There is no IC continuity between rounds. Feel free to befriend people between rounds, but don't make any decisions based on previous rounds.
    - Do not give your metafriends all-access IDs, weapons, or other sensitive things that you wouldn't give to a stranger in the same context.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] After cloning, metempsychosis or taking a ghost role, you [color=#ff0000]forget your previous life[/color].
    - For ghost roles, this is absolute.
    - There is a lot of leniency for people who have been revived as the same character, but the main idea is to not describe who or what killed you. You don't have to act like a total amnesiac otherwise.
    - Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Actions against AFK or SSD players are judged by the same standards as ones that are at their computer. You don't get a pass to grief them as a non-antag.
    - You can secure their PDAs without being an antag: they should be given to another member of their department and returned if they come back.
    - If you feel someone has been AFK for an exceedingly long time, you can ahelp to get them gracefully removed from the round.

SECURITY RULES

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Security is expected to use non-lethal measures unless faced with lethal force or a situation where non-lethal measures arenâ€™t possible.
    - If you still manage to kill someone as security, get them cloned immediately, and make sure their stuff is returned.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Refer to space law for sentencing guidelines.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] If you are going to execute someone, they have a right to a trial.
    - Trials should include a judge, prosecutor, defendant, and jury.
    - We don't expect you to be in expert in real life court proceedings, the main measure to determine if a trial was good enough was that everyone put roleplaying effort in.
    - If this isn't viable in the current round, you can leave them in the permabrig, assuming it's justified.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] All uplink items are the same class of contraband as armory weapons, so they should be secured there and treated with the same processes.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Mantises should do their best to identify the station's psychics, and keep their superiors informed.
    - At the discretion of the Mystagogue or Captain, [color=#ff0000]the mantis and only the mantis[/color] may request a warrant to kill or mindbreak problematic psychics.
    - The warrant needs to include which specific psychic power the person is accused of having, and whether it's for mindbreaking, killing, or both.
    - Mystagogue and Captain have complete discretion to approve or deny the warrant, even with irrefutable evidence that the person is psychic. In fact, it's in everyone's best interest that the majority of warrants are denied.
    - Mindbreaker toxin and cloning both remove psionic powers, which are good options for people that are either cooperative or otherwise not dangerous without psychic powers.

AI RULES

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Asimov laws mean don't hurt humans, period, no matter what. Do not hurt non-human crew, either, except in extreme circumstances or self preservation.

ESCALATION RULES

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Self-defense is always allowed unless you have in-character restrictions on your free will.
    - This is to the extent of saving your own life. In most circumstances, people stop being a threat when they are attempting to disengage or going into crit.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death. Try to respond to words with words, fists with fists, and so on.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Guns, swords, and other deadly weapons signal lethal intent.
    - Don't use these to resolve petty conflicts, and don't brandish them if you don't want to make it clear you're ready to kill or be killed.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attacking. Don't grief crew-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
    - If they are provoking you by e.g. stealing or attacking stuff, you can escalate much more rapidly than with humanoid players.

ANTAGONIST RULES

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way.
    - This is obviously somewhat subjective, but murdering all of medical when you just have to steal something from engineering is frowned upon.
    - Don't fret too much over exact limits here; admins usually err towards the side of most things being allowed. Feel free to shoot that guy that's been annoying you.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Exploits, arrivals camping, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden. For a certain set of objectives, most other things have a place.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Other antagonists are not neccesarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenos, nukies, or zombies.
