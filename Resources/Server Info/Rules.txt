Nyanotrasen is a Medium Roleplay server. We define this as performing your assigned duties. This is a ‘do your job’ server. This means it is important to do what is expected out of your department and not what would be expected out of other departments.
If you have a short attention span and start lashing out when there hasn't been an apocalyptic event for 5 minutes, you may want to join one of the high pop hellpits instead.

[color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] All of these rules apply as they are intended. Do not argue small wording or punctuation technicalities like we're in court.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] The dinstinction between in-character and out-of-character is enforced more strictly than LRP servers. If you want to talk about OOC matters with the people next to you, simply use the "LOOC" chat channel.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] New players are welcome, but please do not take head roles unless you are familiar with the department. If you need to leave as a head role, inform an admin.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] As a non-antagonist, the barrier for self-antagging is fairly low here.
    - Breaking into departs with no one working them because you need something from them is okay, barring the armory unless there is a xeno invasion or similar.
    - Behavior that's accepted elsewhere like mass producing poison or interfering in random people's arrests will not be tolerated.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Follow basic common sense -- act as a reasonable person would in your character's shoes.
    - This isn't a deathmatch, be humane.
    - What is considered a reasonable reason to escalate conflict is listed below under ESCALATION RULES and is at the discretion of admins.
    - Declaring a revolution is normally not allowed, even as an antagonist. It gets messy for the non-antagonists that might participate. Ask admins for permission first.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color].

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Harassment of other players for OOC/meta reasons is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are not allowed.
	- Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, orientation or the like is not tolerated.
	- Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
    - In a station full of strange alien coworkers, the occasional comment may be tolerated. Do not roleplay a "racist" character or discriminate against anyone.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Your IC name must be realistic. It must fit your species or job, you cannot have the names of historically significant people or fictional characters.
    - You can press the random name button in the character creator with a species selected to see what sort of names they have.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Metacommunications, cheating, multi-keying, alternate accounts, or exploiting to crash the server or gain a large mechanical advantage will all result in an appeal-only permanent ban.
    - Do not use external programs to communicate information about the round or modify your game client or how you interface with it.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] There is no IC continuity between rounds. Feel free to befriend people between rounds, but don't make any decisions based on previous rounds.
    - Do not give your metafriends all-access IDs, weapons, or other sensitive things that you wouldn't give to a stranger in the same context.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] After cloning or taking a ghost rule, you [color=#ff0000]forget your previous life[/color].
    - For ghost roles, this is absolute.
    - There is a lot of leniency for clones, but the main idea is to not describe who or what killed you. You don't have to act like a total amnesiac otherwise.
    - Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted.

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Actions against AFK or SSD players are judged by the same standards as ones that are at their computer. You don't get a pass to grief them as a non-antag.
    - In an emergency, like getting someone to the cloning room, you may take their PDA and put it back afterwards.
    - If you feel someone has been AFK for an exceedingly long time, you can ahelp to get them gracefully removed from the round.

SECURITY RULES
[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Security is expected to use non-lethal measures unless faced with lethal force or a situation where non-lethal measures aren’t possible.
    - If you still manage to kill someone as security, get them cloned immediately, and make sure their stuff is returned.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Prisoners who haven't killed anyone shouldn't be brigged longer than 12 minutes, unless they were attempting to kill a head of staff.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Prisoners of capital crimes have a right to a trial. We have lawyers and forensic analysts, use them
    - Trials should include a judge, prosecutor, defendant, and jury.
    - We don't expect you to be in expert in real life court proceedings, the main measure to determine if a trial was good enough was that everyone put roleplaying effort in.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] All uplink items are the same class of contraband as armory weapons, so they should be secured there and treated with the same processes.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Mantises should do their best to identify the station's psychics, and keep their superiors informed. At the discretion of the Mystagogue or Captain, they may request a warrant to kill problematic psychics.
    - Mystagogue and Captain have complete discretion to approve or deny the warrant, even with irrefutable evidence that the person is psychic. In fact, it's in everyone's best interest that the majority of warrants are denied.
    - Remember mantis is eligible for antagonist, so be really careful approving those warrants.

AI RULES
[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Asimov laws mean don't hurt humans, period, no matter what. Do not hurt non-human crew, either, except in extreme circumstances or self preservation.

ESCALATION RULES
[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Self-defense is always allowed unless you have in-character restrictions on your free will.
    - This is to the extent of saving your own life. In most circumstances, people stop being a threat when they are attempting to disengage or going into crit.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death. Try to respond to words with words, fists with fists, and so on.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Guns, swords, and other deadly weapons signal lethal intent.
    - Don't use these to resolve petty conflicts, and don't brandish them if you don't want to make it clear you're ready to kill or be killed.

ANTAGONIST RULES
[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way.
    - This is obviously somewhat subjective, but murdering all of medical when you just have to steal something from engineering is frowned upon.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Exploits, arrivals camping, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden. For a certain set of objectives, most other things have a place.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Other antagonists are not neccesarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenos, nukies, or zombies.
