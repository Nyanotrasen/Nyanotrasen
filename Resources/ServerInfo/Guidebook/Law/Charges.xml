# Charges & Sentencing

This section lists all [color=#a4885c]criminal charges[/color], their [color=#a4885c]sentences[/color] as well as how to sentence a crime.

## Sentencing a Crime
- Find the charge with the highest minimum sentence and consider it a [color=#a4885c]Primary Charge[/color]. Add brig time between its minimum and maximum.
- For each other charge, [color=#a4885c]compound[/color] them by adding brig time in accordance with its limit as below.
- In both steps, make sure to consider the severity of the crime as it may wildly vary based on damage done, area tresspassed etc.
- You may further adjust the sentence based on extenuaning or aggravating circumstances.
- If the brig time for one sentence is higher than 20 minutes, you are authorized to [color=#a4885c]permabrig[/color] the convict.
- Any non-brig punishment is applied at discretion of one passing the sentence. The exception is any [color=#a4885c]Capital Crime[/color], which means a mandatory demotion to Assistant and [color=#a4885c]Abuse of Power[/color] and [color=#a4885c]Conduct Unbecoming[/color], which means a mandatory demotion.
