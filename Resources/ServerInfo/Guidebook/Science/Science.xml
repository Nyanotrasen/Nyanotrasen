# Science

Science, often called Research and Development, is a job made up of both generating research points to unlock new technologies as well as using said technologies to produce new items at lathes to help out the station.

The most important thing inside your department is the R&D server, which stores unlocked technologies, and the R&D computer, which allows you to unlock technologies.

Each technology costs [color=#a4885c]Research Points[/color] and unlocks recipes at lathes. Some technologies will also have prerequesites you have to unlock before you can research them.

At a lathe, you can sync to a server to allow it print whatever recipes you have unlocked. Recipes require various materials (steel, glass, plastic, gold, plasma) which can be acquired at Cargo or Salvage.
