# Xenoarchaeology
Xenoarchaeology is a science subdepartment focused on researching and experimenting on alien artifacts.

## Artifacts

Artifacts consist of a randomly-generated graph structure. They consist of [color=#a4885c]nodes[/color] connected to each other by [color=#a4885c]edges[/color], the traversal of which is the main goal of the scientists working on them.

Each node has two main components: a [color=#a4885c]stimulus[/color] and a [color=#a4885c]reaction[/color]. A stimulus is the external behavior that triggers the reaction. Some reactions are instantaneous effects while others are permanent changes. Triggering the reaction causes the artifact to move through one of the node's edges to an adjacent node.

With these basic principles, you can begin to grasp how the different nodes of an artifact are interconnected, and how one can move between them by repeatedly activating nodes.

While it might seem random to an untrained eye, a skilled scientist can learn to understand the internal structure of any artifact.

## Artifact Analyzer and Analysis Console

The main equipment that you'll be using for Xenoarchaeology is the [color=#a4885c]artifact analyzer[/color] and the [color=#a4885c]analysis console[/color]. You can use these to create reports that contain valuable information about an artifact.

To set them up, simply link them with a network configurator, set an artifact on top of the analyzer, and press the [color=#a4885c]Scan[/color] button.

Using the console, you can extract points from the artifact using the [color=#a4885c]Extract[/color] button. The amount of points you extract is based on how many of the nodes of the artifact have been activated. This will result in an increase of the glimmer count.
