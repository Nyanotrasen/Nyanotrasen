# Epistemics

Epistemics, [color=#888084]or Research and Development for people who refuse to use such a self-aggrandizing name[/color], is one of the main departments on NanoTrasen stations.
They are tolerated despite their strange customs and tendency to attract all sorts of weirdness to the station.

## Technologies

The most important thing inside your department is the [color=#a4885c]R&D server[/color], which stores unlocked technologies, and the [color=#a4885c]R&D computer[/color], which allows you to unlock technologies.

Each technology costs [color=#a4885c]Research Points[/color] and unlocks recipes at [color=#a4885c]lathes[/color]. Some technologies will also have prerequesites you have to unlock before you can research them.

## Lathes

Syncing a lathe to a server allows it to print whatever recipes you have unlocked on that server. Recipes require various materials (steel, glass, plastic, gold, plasma), which can be acquired at Cargo or Salvage.

## Oracle
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Oracle" />

[color=#a4885c]Oracle[/color] is your benefactor, dispensing lots of strange liquids and research points in exchange of items she demands. [color=#888084]Is she a statue, a goddess, some sort of devious trap? Everyone has their own approach to her, but she doesn't seem to care for any of them.[/color]
