The [color=#a4885c]Anomalous Particle Emitter[/color] is a machine used to interface with anomalies. It is the primary way of manipulating the stats of an anomaly.

The A.P.E. can shoot three different kinds of anomalous particles: Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta. Each particle types has certain effects:

- [color=#DC143C]Danger:[/color] Increases the severity of an anomaly.
- [color=#D299D2]Unstable:[/color] Increases the instability of an anomaly.
- [color=#CC9B21]Containment:[/color] Increases the stability at the cost of health.

Which particle type corresponds to each effect is unique and can be learned by scanning the anomaly.

[color=#888084]The A.P.E. can also be locked by anyone with science access, which prevents it from being deconstructed, turned on or off, or having the particle type switched.[/color]
