# Power

SS14 has a fairly in-depth power system through which all devices on the station receive electricity. It's divided into three main powernets by voltage; [color=#cb761a]High Voltage[/color], [color=#cbcb1a]Medium Voltage[/color] and [color=#3c9434]Low Voltage[/color].

## Cabling
The three major cable types (HV, MV, and LV) can be used to form independent powernets. Examine them for a description of their uses.

## Power storage
Each power storage device presented functions as the transformer for its respective power level (HV, MV, and LV) and also provides a battery to help flatten out spikes and dips in power usage.

## Ramping
Contrary to what one might expect from a video game electrical simulation, power is not instantly provided upon request. Generators and batteries take time to ramp up to match the draw imposed on them, which leads to brownouts when there are large changes in current draw all at once, for example when batteries run out.

## Installing power storage
[color=#a4885c]Substations[/color] are the most self-explanatory. Simply install the machine on top of an MV and HV cable, it will draw power from the HV cable to provide to MV.

Installing [color=#a4885c]APCs[/color] is similarly simple, except APCs are exclusively wallmounted machinery and cannot be installed on the floor. Make sure it has both MV and LV connections underneath the wall that will have the APC on it.

Installing a [color=#a4885c]SMES[/color] requires you construct a cable terminal to use as the input. The SMES will draw power from the terminal and send power out from underneath. The terminal will ensure that the HV input and HV output do not connect. [color=#fcdf03]Avoid connecting a SMES to itself, this will result in a short circuit which can result in power flickering or outages.[/color]
