[color=#ff0000]You must be 16 or older to play. Users under 16 will be banned immediately.[/color]
[color=#ff0000]Speak English, please.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]ERP OF ANY KIND IS BANNED.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]This server is an LRP server, not an NRP server.  You are still expected to RP somewhat, but not as much as you are expected on the MRP server.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Follow the community expectations. This includes both in game and elsewhere in our community.

Don't be a dick.
Do not grief as a non-antagonist; this includes against AFK and catatonic players.
Don't be racist or bigoted.
Do not cheat or abuse glitches; please report all bugs on Discord.
Do not evade bans.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Do not use information gained outside of in-character means, and do not say In Character (IC) things in the Local Out Of Character (LOOC) chat channel.

I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as meta-comms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships and relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.
Do not say LOOC things in IC either.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] After cloning, metempsychosis or taking a ghost role, you forget your previous life.

If cloned, you don't have amnesia, but you do forget the last five minutes leading to your death and cannot describe who or what killed you.
Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Security and Command roles are held to a higher standard and must follow space law.

If you don’t have time to play a full round, do not select these roles.
If you need to leave your computer, send an ahelp and notify your fellow crew via the radio.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Follow Chat Guidelines

Only speak in English.
Do not spam.
Do not advertise.
Do not use netspeak in character (i.e. LOL, ROFL).
Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are not allowed. Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are not allowed.
No Simulated Racism, While you don’t have to like everybody, you should not be acting upon your distaste for other races/morphotypes.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] All constructed/summoned beings are bound by their laws and must abide by these laws.

If a being has a master, they must follow their master's orders.
Your master is held accountable if they order you to do something malicious.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Follow Roleplay Guidelines

Be sure to capitalize your character's First and Last name.
Your character's name cannot include profanity (i.e. Dixie Nourmus, Mike Hawk, John Dildo, etc.)
Treat your character as a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences and not your own as the player.
By picking prisoner, you have chosen to RP as a prisoner. While escape is allowed, there are consequences for your actions.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Follow Escalation Guidelines

Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.
Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attacking. Don't grief crew-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Follow Antagonist Guidelines

The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. However antagonists have leniency in regards to what they can and can’t do. If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin.
Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs, nuclear operatives, or zombies.
Exploits, arrivals camping, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden.
